Prompt
Develop infrastructure that supports the delivery of Cloud Pizza.
The API Gateway should accept a web request from a user and begin the process of creating
and delivering a pizza.
The step function should orchestrate the specifics of this process. You may wish to add new
lambdas and organize your code as you deem necessary.
If a failure occurs during the pizza creation and delivery process, develop functionality that could
be used to notify the customer or production support (Placeholder functions may be utilized to
imply extended functionality here).
The project should support tests, to ensure that further enhancements to the pizza delivery
process can be made in a stable manner. Add unit tests for one lambda of your choice to
demonstrate your knowledge of unit testing fundamentals.
